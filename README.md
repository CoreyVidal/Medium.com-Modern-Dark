## Installation

This theme is an installable style add-on for the browser extension Stylus. To use this theme, you must install Stylus first:

ðŸŽ¨ Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

(I haven't tested it, but this theme possibly/probably works in Stylus for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and/or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/).)

Once Stylus is installed:

ðŸ“¦ [Click here to install this theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoreyVidal/Medium.com-Modern-Dark/master/medium-modern-dark.user.css). It supports automatic updates.

This style does have an official presence on userstyles.org, which you can install here if you want: https://userstyles.org/styles/186110/medium-modern-dark   
...but don't do thatâ€”that website sucks.

## History

Medium used to have a [number of working themes on userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/browse/medium), but then last year Medium completely changed their website and obscured their style names with random letters. There doesn't seem to be any maintained themes since this switch, so I took a crack at it.

This style is based on [this code](https://gist.github.com/xenogew/1339ef3b43b966a148114ce0c40f4ede) I found by [xenogew](https://gist.github.com/xenogew), (last updated September 2019) who based their work off of [this old userstyle](https://widget.userstyles.org/styles/167953/medium-dark) by [ultimatetoast27](https://widget.userstyles.org/users/726366) (last updated January 2019).

## Notes

I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm self-taught novice with CSS, and a lot of what I'm doing is just guessing, without actually knowing how it works. I've also never created a public repo before.

I encourage you to fork it or do whatever you'd like with it. If someone wants to take over this repo, please doâ€”I don't expect to be maintaining it.
